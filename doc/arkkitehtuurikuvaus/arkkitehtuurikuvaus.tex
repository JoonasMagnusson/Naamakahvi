\section{Introduction}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item High-level description of overall architecture
% \item Main functionalities described in natural language
% \end{itemize}

The staff of the Department of Computer Science has two coffee syndicates. 
Both of them provide an espresso machine and the other syndicate also has 
a drip coffee maker. The members pay for their coffee by bringing products 
to be used in the machine, e.g. espresso beans or filters. The Facecafe 
software keeps track of each member’s balance, using face recognition to 
identify users. The Facecafe software is supposed to replace earlier 
methods for track keeping.

Registration is required to use the system. Upon registration, pictures are
taken of the user's face for later identification. If the user does not want
to use face recognition, they can choose not to have any pictures taken. 
Images can also be added after registration. Coffee can be bought or paid 
for by first choosing a product to buy or bring and then taking a picture to 
identify the user whose balance will be updated. Alternatively, the user can
be identified using their username. 

\section{System Purpose: Requirements}

\subsubsection*{Android User Interface}
% android-ui ihmiset voisivat kirjoittaa tästä enemmän (myös frontendin opencv-juduista)

The user interface for Android is written in Java, and uses the client
library to facilitate communications with the server.

\subsubsection*{Swing User Interface}
% swing-ui ihmiset voisivat kirjoittaa tästä enemmän (myös frontendin opencv-juduista)
     
The Swing user interface is written in Java and provides an interface
between the users and the server. The UI shows product and user account
information stored on the server and allows users to manage account
and purchase information.

The Swing user interface is designed to operate on Windows, Linux and
Mac devices. It does not communicate with the backend directly, but rather
uses the client library to facilitate communications with the server.
It also uses the third-party OpenCV and JavaCV libraries to detect faces
from a camera feed. The faces are sent to the server in order to identify
users, allowing them to sign in to the system without entering their
usernames or other information.

\subsubsection*{Client/Frontend}
The client is implemented as a Java library and its responsibility is
to offer an interface for UI-components, abstracting away the
communication protocols used between the client and server. The client 
communicates with the server via HTTP, sending GET and POST requests, 
and receiving JSON-objects from the server. 

For a more detailed description, see the client Javadoc.

\subsubsection*{Backend/Server}
% redox ja mahnu vois varmaan kirjoittaa tähän jotain tarkempaa, ja
% ehkä jakaa tämän kohdan useampaan kohtaan jos siltä tuntuu. (+ naama- ja station-tietokannat ja serverin opencv-palikka)
The server updates the database and gets data from it on client
requests and tells the client whether or not the requested operation
was successful. The server is an HTTP-server implemented in Python, and
is connected to a PostgreSQL database.

\section{Other Views}


\subsection{Process}
% Process: in a running system, how components are divided as processes
% --> e.g. There are can be multiple instances of KujeProcessor, but can
% there be multiple instances of KujeServer?
% --> Has multiple instances of KujeProcessor ever been tested? Has
% multiple instances of KujeServer ever been tested?
\subsubsection*{Backend}
There should generally only be one backend server that is used by any
client, since one server can handle multiple stations by using
different database for each station.

\subsubsection*{Frontend}
Any number of frontends can be used simultaneously with the same
server, provided that each of them uses a different station. It has
not been tested what would happen if multiple frontends try to use the
same station simultaneously.

\subsection{Development}
% Development: Where in code the codebase components are implemented

The components are located in the following directories in the codebase:
\begin{itemize}
\item Client: Naamakahvi/Naamakahvi-parent/client

\item Server: Naamakahvi/Python

\item Android UI: Naamakahvi/Naamakahvi-parent/android-ui

\item Swing UI: Naamakahvi/Naamakahvi-parent/swingui
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Physical}
% Physical: How components are separated in the hardware level
% --> e.g. Division between the frontend and the backend; list also all physical
% dependencies between components, e.g. ``KujeProcessor and WebApp must stay
% on the same physical server because ...

Since the frontend and the backend communicate using HTTP, they can be
located on separate physical servers. %tietokannat?

\subsection{Constraints}
The accuracy of face recognition depends highly on the light in the 
photographs. Poor lighting or changes in it can lead to inaccurate results.
To achieve the best possible face recognition results, the camera should be 
placed in a well lit environment.

\section{Testing}

\subsection{Android UI}

\subsection{Swing UI}
The Swing-UI component has unit tests written using the FEST-Swing (fest.easytesting.org)
and JUnit (www.junit.org) testing APIs. The tests are included with the source code in the
Naamakahvi-parent/swingui/src/test/ directory. 

The tests for individual UI views use a dummy main-UI class (DummyCafeUI.java) to provide
test data, while the tests for the main UI class use a dummy client (DummyClient.java).

Notably, the methods relating to the face recognition functionality in the program were
not tested, as this would have required emulating a camera feed and was therefore outside
the scope of the project.

\subsection{Client}
The client has JUnit tests for its methods. The tests use Apache LocalTestServer as a test
server.
